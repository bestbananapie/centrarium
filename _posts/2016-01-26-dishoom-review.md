From the moment you step through the door, the vivid thematic decor will confuse your purpose for being there. The coherence in style almost makes it feel like you are in a movie set, and the large vaulted ceilings and clock makes it feel like you are at a train station. This is quickly forgotten however, as the fourty-five minutes queue to get here, has your tummy grumbling for food and you started looking around for that empty table that has your name on it.

Being sitted at the lounge is perfect for that slightly hangover, its a bit to early to be active on a Sunday feeling. Sitting on the sofa overlooking the bar and resturant, it seemed like the whole world was passing you by, but it is just the waiters and patrons walking around in what is a fairly large resturant. 

Getting down to business, you focus on the menu. You would be forgiven for not wrapping your head around it, there is 4 columns and a few rows, wait what happened to that spreadsheet you were working on earlier in the week? Your mind wanders and you let your friends do the ordering while you look out onto the resturant again. You start noticing that all the waiters are westerns and happily moving about the resturant with a lot of energy.

### Starters
We ordered three starters to share. Okra Fries, spiced lamb keema, and chili cheese toast.

I would definetly recommend the Ocra fries, the chili cheese toast was well just cheese on toast and the lamb dish was nothing to get excited about. 

We ordered a few more mains to share, the esstential garlic naan, ruby curry, chicken biryani and chloe bhatura .

## Staff/ Service
Our waiter was an easy going guy, and even sounded pretty smart when he explained these indian dishes to us. Although I am not sure we share the same humor as he tried to be funny by saying "where is your contactless card duuude???" when I tried to pay. My only thought was __just take my money and let me leave__

# Conclusion

- **Food** = 6/10
- **Value for money** = 7/10
- **Uniqueness** = 8/10

**Will I try and go back?** No
