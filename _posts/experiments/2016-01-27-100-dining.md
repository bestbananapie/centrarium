I am doing an experiment this year to see if I can do 100 different dining experiences without double takes. Why not, life is crazy? 

##The Motivation
I really enjoy eating out with friends, and do it quite a lot. However I always end up back at the same few spots, enjoying the same food that I know I like. Since it costs a premium to live in London, I just felt like I should start taking advantage of its offering. So I decided I should make 2016 the year of trying new places!

##The Rules
The rules are pretty simple. A restaurant counts on the list if I sit down and eat in at the restaurant. Take-away meals do not count, unless that restaurant has already been on the list. This is to prevent me from circumventing the system by ordering take-away for the sake of it, but keeps go-to take-away places off the list! The only expection is if I am forced to go somewhere, i.e. my boss invites me.

How far do I think I can make it? No idea, I have a feeling that staying away from my favourite places might be the biggest challenge.

## Thoughts

##### 07 March 2016

It is getting increasingly difficult to keep to this. It was a mistake to go to all my favourite/fimilar places in the begining, now all that is left is the unfimilar. Going forward I also want to try and maintain a list of places I want to try because I am too picky to risk choosing a restaurant on the fly! I am also considering stopping the experiment at 50 restaurants, I will see closer to the day.

## Conclusion
To come...
