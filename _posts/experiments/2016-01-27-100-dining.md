I am doing an experiment this year to see if I can do 100 different dining experiences without double takes. Why not, life is crazy? 

The rules are pretty simple. A restaurant counts on the list if I sit down and eat in at the restaurant. Take-away meals do not count, unless that restaurant has already been on the list. This is to prevent me from circumventing the system by ordering take-away for the sake of it, but keeps go-to take-away places off the list! The only expection is if I am forced to go somewhere, i.e. my boss invites me.

The penality for failures is that I have to buy NC and SH dinner at Latymers in Hammersmith.

How far do I think I can make it? No idea, I have a feeling that staying away from my favourite places might be the biggest challenge.
