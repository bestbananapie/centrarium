I am doing an experiment this year to see if I can do 100 different dining experiences without double takes. Why not, life is crazy? 

The rules are pretty simple. A restaurant counts on the list if I sit down and eat in at the restaurant. Take-away meals do not count, unless that restaurant has already been on the list. This is to prevent me from circumventing the system by ordering take-away for the sake of it, but keeps go-to take-away places off the list! 

How far do I think I can make it? No idea, I have a feeling that staying away from my favourite places might be the biggest challenge.

## The list 

1. 11/01 - Itsu
2. 12/01 - Italia Uno
3. 13/01 - Zizzi's
4. 15/01 - Diwana
5. 16/01 - The Riding House Cafe
6. 17/01 - Opso
7. 17/01 - Taro
9. 22/01 - Subway
10. 23/01 - KFC
12. 24/01 - Dishoom
13. 26/01 - Palms of Goa
14. 27/01 - Kennedy's
15. 29/01 - Burger King`
16. 30/01 - Four Seasons
17. 31/01 - Made in Camden
18. 31/01 - Kanada-Ya
