I am doing an experiment this year to see if I can do 100 different dining experiences without double takes. Why not, life is crazy? 

The rules are pretty simple, if I sit down at the restaurant to eat it counts and I cannot go back till I hit the big 100. Take aways do not count!

How far do I think I can make it? No idea, I have a feeling that staying away from my favourite places might be the biggest challenge.

## The list 

1. Itsu
2. Italia Uno
3. Zizzi's
4. Diwana
5. The Riding House Cafe
6. Opso
7. Taro
9. Subway
10. KFC
12. Dishoom
13. Palms of Goa
