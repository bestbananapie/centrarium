I am doing an experiment this year to see if I can do 100 different dining experiences without double takes. Why not, life is crazy? 

The rules are pretty simple, if I sit down at the restaurant to eat it counts and I cannot go back till I hit the big 100. Take aways do not count!

How far do I think I can make it? No idea, I have a feeling that staying away from my favourite places might be the biggest challenge.

## The list 

1. 11/01 - Itsu
2. 12/01 - Italia Uno
3. 13/01 - Zizzi's
4. 15/01 - Diwana
