I am doing a crazy experiment to see if I can go to 100 different resturant experiences without double takes. Why not, life is crazy? 

The rules are simple, if sit down it counts and I cannot go back till I hit 100. Take aways do not count!

## The list 

1. Itsu
2. Italia Uno
3. Zizzi's
4. Diwana
5. The Riding House Cafe
6. Opso
7. Taro
9. Subway
10. KFC
12. Dishoom
13. Palms of Goa
